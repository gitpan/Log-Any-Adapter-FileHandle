# NAME

Log::Any::Adapter::FileHandle - A basic Log::Any::Adapter to forward messages to a filehandle

# VERSION

version 0.007

# SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Any qw($log);
  use Log::Any::Adapter;

  # Send all logs to Log::Any::Adapter::FileHandle
  Log::Any::Adapter->set('FileHandle');

  $log->info("Hello world");
 

# DESCRIPTION

This module is a basic adapter that will simply forward log messages to a filehandle, or any object that
supports a 'print' method ([IO::String](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::String), [IO::Socket::INET](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Socket::INET), Plack's $env->{psgi.errors} object, etc).

I've created it so that my scripts running under damontools or runit can output
messages to locally defined logs.  It does not timestamp messages, that responsbility  is
delegated to the external log capture mechanism.

You can override the default configuration by passing extra arguments to the
`Log::Any` set_adapter method:

- fh

Pass in your IO::Handle-like object here.  If this isn't specified, it will default to opening STDERR. 
If the object supports an autoflush method, autoflush will be enabled, unless no_autoflush is set.

- no_autoflush

Disable automatically turning on autoflush on the fh object.

- format

A sprintf string that controls the formatting of the message.  It is supplied 2
arguments: the log level as supplied by Log::Any (usually all-lowercase), and
the message to be logged.  The default is "[%s] %s\n".  This value should contain the log
record terminator, such as a newline.
